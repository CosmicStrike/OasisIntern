            <div class="content">
                Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937. He is the son of
                Naval Tata,
                who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group
                founder Jamsetji
                Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948,
                when Tata was 10,
                his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and
                widow of Ratanji
                Tata. He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata[8] and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second
                marriage with
                Simone Tata, with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.

            <div class="content">
                In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by
                turning the
                subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic
                slowdown.
                In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata
                faced stiff
                resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under
                the senior Tata's
                tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the
                implementation
                of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries
                to contribute
                their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many
                responsibilities to
                younger talent. Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined
                into company-wide
                operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation

            <div class="title">Philanthropy</div>
            <div class="content">
                Tata is a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading
                philanthropist in
                India. Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering to develop
                capacitive
                deionization to provide improved water for challenged areas.

                Tata Hall at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) is a state-of-the-art research
                facility that was
                opened in November 2018. The building is named after the Tata Trusts, who donated $70 million to UC San
                Diego in 2016 to
                establish the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society (TIGS), which is housed within the building.

                In 2014, Tata Group endowed the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and formed the Tata Center for
                Technology and
                Design (TCTD) to develop design and engineering principles suited to the needs of people and communities
                with limited
                resources. They gave ₹950 million to the institute which was the largest ever donation received in its
                history.

                Tata Trusts under the Chairmanship of Ratan Tata provided a grant of ₹750 million to the Centre for
                Neuroscience, Indian
                Institute of Science to study mechanisms underlying the cause of Alzheimer's disease and to evolve
                methods for its early
                diagnosis and treatment. This grant was to be spread over 5 years starting in 2014.
                Tata Group, under the leadership of Ratan Tata formed the MIT Tata Center of Technology and Design at
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a mission to address the challenges of
                resource-constrained
                communities, with an initial focus on India.
